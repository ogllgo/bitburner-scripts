This will get backdoors for everything you can, checking for updates twice a second.


Imports and general stuff:
    if you aren't using a typescript file, you can ignore the import { NS };
    if it screams because you aren't using TS, replace all the 'let foo:type = baa'

    import { getRoot } is just my personal getRoot function. You can replace it with yours if you'd like, 
    since it uses constant 'root' instead of 'getroot'.
    your function will have to return 'true' if the server has a backdoor, or 'false' if it doesn't,
    since mine relies on that in The Big Continue.

    Functions, for me, require ns AND args to be specified, not just the args. You can remove the (ns)
    from functions if it yells at you.

Why all servers?
    You want to have servers like nitesec, I.I.I.I, The-Cave, and more, backdoored.
    But what if you want to connect to phantasy? You'd either scan-analyze, but that's annoying and clogs the terminal.
    Besides, what if they add a new faction that's gated behind backdooring?
    Also, I don't like hardcoding information - it just feels nasty.
    so, I made a seperate little script. This, as an extra thing, automatically wins the game
    if you're INT farming, don't run this beyond getting all servers (for obvious reasons)

Why two scripts?
    because otherwise you'll have to backdoor 90 servers with no speed increases, 
    and backdoors are slow. it also lets it be cleaner.

Why are there comments?
    it looks empty otherwise
